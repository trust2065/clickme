# ClickView skill assessment

## Task 1: Set up a public git repository

You will submit your code to us via a public git repository. We strongly recommend using GitHub or GitLab, but any public git provider is acceptable. **Please commit your code at the end of every task.**

## Task 2: Set up simple navigation

Create 2 pages. One will be used for viewing videos, and the other will be used for viewing playlists. You should provide a simple navigation menu that allows the user to switch between these 2 pages.

## Task 3: Display the videos and playlists

Display all the items in the video array in the provided `video.js` file on the videos page. Then, display all the items in the playlists array in the provided `playlists.js` file. How you display these items is up to you (grid, list, table, tiles, etc).

## Task 4: Add a page for viewing the videos inside each playlist

When the user clicks on a playlist, they should be taken to a new page that contains the videos in that playlist.

## Task 5: Playlist creation/deletion

Add actions for both creating new playlists, and deleting existing playlists.

## Task 6: Video management in playlists

The user should be able to add videos to playlists, as well as remove videos from playlists.

This involves adding the appropriate actions to videos on both the videos page, and the playlist videos page.

## Task 7: Provide bulk actions [Optional]

Add functionality for users to be able to add multiple videos to playlists at once using checkboxes. Also, offer the same functionality but for removing videos from playlists where appropriate.

For example, I should be able to "check" a selection of videos from a video list page, and then easily be able to add all of those videos to playlists with 1 action.

## Task 8: Get creative [Optional]

If you find yourself with leftover time, feel free to try to impress us with some creativity. There is room in this application for improvements, and we would love to see what you can come up with. For example, adding pagination to the video lists, adding sorting, etc.

## Task 9: Create a readme.md [Compulsory]

Provide instructions on how to get your code up and running as a `readme.md` file in your git repository. Please also list any dependencies that are not managed by a package manager.
